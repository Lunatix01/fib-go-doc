# Configuration

Now, It's time to see, how we can authenticate using our credentials.

To create a new FIB client, simply use the New function with your clientID and clientSecret.
The third argument specifies whether you are using the testing environment (**true for testing, false for production**).

Here is an example to create a client, under the hood it authenticates and returns access token:

```go filename="main.go" copy
clientID := "your-client-id"
clientSecret := "your-client-secret"

// is it testing environment or production environment
isTesting := false

client, err := fib.New(clientID, clientSecret, isTesting)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Error creating FIB client: %s - %s", err.Title, err.Description)
}
```

## Error handling

The New function returns an error of type \*LoginError if the client creation fails.
This custom error type provides more context about what went wrong during the initialization.

The `LoginError` struct contains two fields:

```txt Title:
Title: A short description of the error.
Description: A more detailed explanation of the error.
```

```go
type LoginError struct {
	Title       string
	Description string
}
```
