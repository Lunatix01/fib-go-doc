# Check a Payment

The `CheckPayment` method allows you to check the status of an existing payment transaction.

This is crucial for confirming whether a payment has been successfully processed, declined, or is still pending.

| Parameters  |                           Definition                            |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------: |
| `paymentID` | The unique identifier for the payment you wish to cancel, UUID. |

```go filename="payment.go" copy
client, err := fib.New(clientID, clientSecret, isTesting)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Error creating FIB client: %s - %s", err.Title, err.Description)
}

// Check the status of an existing payment
response, checkErr := client.CheckPayment(someUUID)
if checkErr != nil {
    log.Fatal("Error checking payment:", checkErr.ErrorBody)
}

log.Printf("Payment Status: %s", response.Status)
```
